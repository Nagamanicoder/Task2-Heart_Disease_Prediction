# HeartCare AI – Heart Disease Prediction System


This project is a machine learning–powered web application that predicts the risk of heart disease based on patient health parameters. The app provides doctors, healthcare workers, and patients with an AI-assisted decision support system for early detection and monitoring of heart disease.


## Tech Stack

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, XGBoost, Joblib)

Streamlit (for UI and deployment)

Machine Learning Workflow: Data preprocessing → Model training → Evaluation → Deployment.
